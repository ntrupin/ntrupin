# Hi! I'm Noah

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in computer science with a concentration in machine intelligence at **Purdue University**. I am currently a research assistant at the **Cognitive Robot Autonomy & Learning (CoRAL)** Lab, advised by professor Ahmed Quereshi and Zixing Weng, where I work with vision language models.

Previously, I worked on parallel optimization and conjugate gradient method research with the **Yang Group** under professor Xiaotao Yang, backend development at **Straato**, simulation physics at **The Lawrenceville School** with Dr. Keith Voss, and regression modeling with the **Stroud Water Research Center** under Dr. Stephen Laubach.

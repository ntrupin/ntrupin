## About this site

This site is entirely hand-written. The backend uses Python and the Flask web framework with Jinja2 for templating, PostgreSQL as its database, and Werkzeug for authentication. The frontend uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Pico.css for base styling. I currently host the database on Heroku and the client/server on Vercel. I also have an RSS feed. GitHub CI/CD manages deployment from this GitHub repository.

Pages are generated from Markdown. Layout takes inspiration from the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme.

Started as a static site hosted on GitHub Pages in 2018, ntrupin.com now serves as a dynamic hub for my projects, writing, and more.

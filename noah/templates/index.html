<h3>Home</h3>
<p>Welcome to my website! Here serves to showcase my writings, projects, and other odds and ends I find interesting.</p>
<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>This site is entirely hand-written. The backend uses <strong>Python</strong> and the <strong>Flask</strong> web framework with <strong>Jinja2</strong> for templating, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as its database, and <strong>Werkzeug</strong> for authentication. The frontend uses vanilla <strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</strong> with <strong>Pico.css</strong> for base styling. I currently host the database on <strong>Heroku</strong> and the client/server on <strong>Vercel</strong>. I also have an <strong><a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a></strong>. <strong>GitHub CI/CD</strong> manages deployment from <strong><a href="https://github.com/ntrupin/website">this GitHub repository</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Static pages are generated from <strong>Markdown</strong> using <strong><a href="https://github.com/ntrupin/website/blob/main/mdutil.py">this utility script</a></strong>. Layout takes inspiration from the <strong>Minimal Mistakes</strong> Jekyll theme.</p>
<p>Started as a static site hosted on GitHub Pages in 2018, ntrupin.com now serves as a dynamic hub for my projects, writing, and more.</p>

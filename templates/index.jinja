      I am a third-year undergraduate student at Purdue University studying computer science (honors) with a concentration in machine intelligence and a (completed) minor in mathematics. I research <i>physics-informed diffusion networks</i> under <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/">Yexiang Xue</a> and <i>robot perception and planning</i> at the <a href="https://corallab.net/">Cognitive Robot Autonomy and Learning Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://wzx16.github.io/">Zixing Wang</a> and <a href="https://qureshiahmed.github.io/">Ahmed Qureshi</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside formal research, I am interested in programming languages and compilers as tools for building and optimizing domain-specific high-performance systems.

    <p>
      I will join <a href="https://optiver.com/">Optiver</a> as a software engineer intern for Summer 2026.

      Previously, I wrote some physics-informed operators for diffusion and researched physics-constrained and VLM-informed robot task planning. I also built out the bank-side infrastructure for Google Autofill at <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/tech/">Capital One</a>, designed parallel routines for solving large sparse systems in seismology with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xiaotaoyanggeo/home">Yang Group</a>, developed experimental trading environments at Straato, built interactive physics simulation software for <a href="https://sentinel.lawrenceville.org/">Sentinel</a>, deployed sensors and modeled water quality data for endangered rivers with <a href="https://stroudcenter.org/">Stroud</a>, and worked on optical music recognition and playback.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have received awards from <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/">Purdue CS</a> and <a href="https://www.l3harris.com/">L3Harris</a> for my work.
